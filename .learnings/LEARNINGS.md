## [LRN-20260201-001] deployment_environment_variables

**Logged**: 2026-02-01T23:52:00Z
**Priority**: high
**Status**: pending
**Area**: infra

### Summary
Railway deployment failing due to missing required environment variables

### Details
The SwarmOracle backend requires DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, and API_SECRET environment variables to start successfully. Railway deployment is returning 404 errors indicating the service isn't starting properly.

### Suggested Action
1. Access Railway dashboard and configure environment variables:
   - DATABASE_URL (auto-generated by Railway PostgreSQL service)
   - JWT_SECRET (generate strong secret)
   - API_SECRET (generate strong secret)
2. Verify deployment logs to confirm successful startup
3. Test health endpoint: https://swarmoracle-production.up.railway.app/health
